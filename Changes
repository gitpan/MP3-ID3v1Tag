1.06 (Jan 27, 2000)
----
- Made the ID3 Genres accessible from outside the package
  for use by third party wrappers. (Olaf Maetzner)
- Strip all text after a null. Some players (such as winamp)
  space pad the fields, while others simply just terminate
  the string with a null. The spec on http://www.id3.org/id3v1.html
  states to null pad the string. (Sander van Zoest, Jason Bodnar)
- Fixed the got_tag() method, it called find_tag_id3v1 as a routine,
  rather then a method. (Sander van Zoest, Peter Johansson)
- Now gracefully return undef rather then calling die when unable
  to open the file. (Peter Johansson)
- Made some cosmetic changes.
